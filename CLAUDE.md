# Important Guidelines

## Before Making Any Changes

1. **ALWAYS check existing files first** - Use `ls`, `Read`, or `Glob` to understand what's already in the directory before creating new files
2. **Never assume the directory is empty** - There may be existing implementations that just need to be run
3. **Check package.json scripts** - Look at existing npm scripts to understand how the project is meant to be run
4. **Prefer using existing files** - Edit existing files rather than creating new ones when possible
